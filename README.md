# Schrodinger Equation - Quantum Simulations  

This repository contains numerical simulations of quantum mechanics problems using **Python**. The simulations are based on solving the **time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation (TDSE)** for different potential configurations.  

The project is structured as an **introduction to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)** applied to quantum physics, including examples such as the **heat equation, harmonic oscillator, quantum tunneling, and Young's double-slit experiment**.
